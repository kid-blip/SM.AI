# SM.AI
SM.AI is a cross-platform C++ console calculator. It uses a robust RPN parser for math (supports basic operations, unary minus, and abs()), and includes a versatile unit converter for speed, temp, and mass (e.g., kg ↔ lb, C ↔ F). Built for stability, it features standard shell commands (help, clear, exit).
